# RAG Application over Custom Company Data

## Description
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that works over custom company data. It allows users to query company-specific information through a context-aware chatbot powered by Generative AI. The application retrieves relevant data from the knowledge base and incorporates it into prompts for the LLM, providing accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Features
- Context-aware registration chatbot over custom company data  
- Integration with **LangChain** for AI workflows  
- Uses **LangChain-Google-GenAI** for chat generative AI  
- Gemini models employed for LLM responses  
- **LangChain-Chroma** for database storage and retrieval  
- Directory and Text loaders for structured knowledge base data  
- Clean and modular project structure with `implementation/` and `knowledge-base/` folders    

## Conclusion
This RAG application provides an efficient and context-aware solution for handling registration queries over custom company data. By combining LangChain, Google Generative AI, and Chroma database, it demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to build intelligent chatbots that understand and respond accurately to user queries. The modular structure ensures the project can be easily extended or adapted for other company-specific datasets in the future.
